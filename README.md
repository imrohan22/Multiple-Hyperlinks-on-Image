# Multiple-Hyperlinks-on-Image
####Have different links on single image.

Create multiple "Hot Spots" linking within a single image, without slicing any image for linking.

For instance, your client has given you a list of sponsors and he wants each of the logo to be linked to the sponsor's web page on his website. This will make your job much easier.

Below image is used for the demo :

![Image of Logos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imrohan22/Multiple-Hyperlinks-on-Image/master/images/logos.jpg)

This is **single image** and you can set different clicks on defferent logos using `<map>` and `<area>` command.

Parameters of `<area>` are :
```HTML
<area shape="area shape"
    coords="area coordinates"
    href="area hyperlink" or nohref="nohref"
    target="hyperlink target"
    title="area title"
    alt="alternate text"/>
```

You can set your coordinates based on your requirements.
Below image will guide you with shapes and their parameters:

You can also set coordinates of image using online tool.
I recommend this [online-tool](https://www.image-maps.com/).
